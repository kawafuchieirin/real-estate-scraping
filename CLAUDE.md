# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a real estate scraping repository (不動産スクレイピングのリポジトリ) that is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Development Status

The project is newly initialized and does not yet have:
- A defined technology stack
- Source code implementation
- Dependencies or package management
- Build or test infrastructure

When implementing the scraping functionality, consider:
- Choosing an appropriate scraping framework (e.g., Python with BeautifulSoup/Scrapy, Node.js with Puppeteer)
- Setting up proper error handling for network requests
- Implementing rate limiting to respect target websites
- Creating a data storage solution for scraped information

This file should be updated as the project develops to include:
- Specific commands for running, testing, and building the application
- Architecture decisions and code structure
- Important implementation details specific to the chosen scraping approach
